      <h2>Vision</h2>      
        <p>The NorCal Time Trial Series aspires to make 
        the excitement of competitive racing events 
        on iconic Northern California racetracks available 
        to all enthusiasts without the costs or risks of 
        wheel-to-wheel racing.</p>

      <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>The NorCal Time Trial Series will hold at least 
          one event per month on a track such as Sonoma 
          Raceway, Thunderhill Raceway, or WeatherTech Raceway 
          at Laguna Seca. Full safety equipment is required, 
          and your car must pass technical inspection before
